Got you — here’s a **clean, copy-paste-ready message** you can drop straight onto the Netlify site (or send to collaborators). I wrote it in plain, reassuring language so non-technical people don’t panic, but it’s still accurate.

### ⚠️ Demo Site — How This Works

Welcome! This site is currently a **demo / sandbox environment**.

Nothing here is final, permanent, or public-facing — so feel free to explore without stress.

**What this site is right now**

* This is a **working draft** used for design, layout, and content experimentation.
* The **site name, URL, branding, and structure can all be changed at any time**.
* Edits made here are for testing and iteration only.
* Think of this as a **whiteboard or prototype**, not the finished product.

**What this site is NOT**

* It is **not officially published** to a public audience.
* It is **not indexed for search engines**.
* It is **not locked in** — nothing here is permanent.

### 🔁 How the workflow works (high level)

1. We design and refine the site **here in the demo**

   * Layout
   * Colors
   * Fonts
   * Pages
   * Content structure
2. Once the design looks right:

   * The site can be **published publicly**
   * A **custom domain** can be attached (e.g. `yourname.com`)
   * The site name and URL can be finalized
   * Search engines can be enabled
   * Analytics, forms, and interactivity can be turned on

### 🚀 How this becomes a fully public, functional website

To make this site live and accessible to everyone, the following steps happen:

1. **Finalize design & content**

   * Confirm layout, branding, and pages
2. **Connect a custom domain**

   * Purchase or attach a domain name
3. **Enable production deployment**

   * Switch from demo/sandbox to live publishing
4. **Turn on public access**

   * Allow search engines and external visitors
5. **Optional upgrades**

   * Contact forms
   * User accounts
   * CMS editing
   * Analytics
   * Performance optimization

At that point, this becomes a **fully functional, real website** that anyone can visit and interact with.

### 🧘 Bottom line

This space is intentionally low-pressure.

* You **cannot break anything**
* Everything is **reversible**
* Everything is **editable**
* Nothing is final until we say it is

We design here first — and publish only when we’re ready.

If you want, next I can:

* Make this **shorter / more casual**
* Rewrite it for a **banner or modal**
* Add a **“Demo Mode” badge**
* Convert this into a **homepage callout box**
* Or tailor it to **non-technical collaborators vs developers**

Just tell me the vibe.
